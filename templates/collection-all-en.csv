Seyni,AWA CAMARA,"(Senegal, 1939-)",Seny-Awa.jpg,"Seyni Awa has always contested ancestral prohibitions. She has displayed her eccentricity, her fantasies and the “evil” spirits inside her.  She makes fun of the rules and gives full rein to all her fantasies. In the yard in front of the house, she models her clay figures, half-women, half-monsters and produces other little laughing monsters. In a hole, the most rudimentary kiln imaginable, also in front of the house, she fires these creatures, which may reach up to one meter high."
Yassir,AMAZINE,"(Belgium, 1975- )",amazine-ok.jpg,"Yassir Amazine attended the classes of Luc Mondry and Nicole Babilas at La Clarière.His drawings are in ball point, black, red, green or blue. He sings or hums while drawing, and speaks rarely or not at all. In fact, is he singing? Is he drawing? Or is he running away? He never looks for a model for his drawings. Some subjects are repeated: sun, house and mosque, aeroplane, car, guitar. An apparent disorder but the paper is entirely covered (usually both sides), it all makes sense. Yassir Amazine has finished his drawing, and has stopped singing. The drawing begins its own life, it exists in its own right, nourished by the artist."
Inès,ANDOUCHE,"(Belgium, 1958 - )",InesAndouche2330.JPG,"For the ten years in her life she lived an itinerant life with her parents in Africa, principally in the Congo. In 1961 Inès return in Europe and attended several different institutions in Switzerland and then in France, where she joined Hemptinne Centre’s creative studio. She draws with great intensity. With strong gestures she tackles pictures in magazines, taking them over and giving them a new life. This apparently simple mental transfer dignifies the insignificant, the ordinary or even the ignored. Her univers probably conveys some memories of the culture of her childhood, today conducted by a strong artistic personality."
Umberto,BERGAMASCHI,"(Milan, 1954 -)",Bergamaschi1ok.jpg,"The habit of putting a circle round his subjects arose by chance during the exploratory phase when he was absorbed in copying a coin. Umberto Bergamaschi got great inner satisfaction from it and has never given up the circular shape. Each thing is presented as a pure effigy, without depth, in a foetal universe where space and time are banished. This opting for abstraction and avoidance of reality reflect his tendency to take refuge in a silent universe.He works in the Andrea & Michele painting studio."
Paul,BLOCKX,"(Belgium, 1961 – 2015)",BlockxPaul1892.JPG,"The graphic work of Paul Blockx immerse the spectator into a world of pain. The artist imposes us, in a strong way and frankly, the hell of his life, the psychic suffering which he is subjected for several years. For him, as for many artists, creation means a release, a way of shouting his pain and of transcending it. He offers us a strong and authentic work which is a reflection of the author’s soul and which contains a symbolic part of his intimate story. Sometimes shocked, sometimes moved, sometimes upset by the message of this self-portrait, no visitor can remain uncaring in front of this work-mirror."
Ignacio,CARLES-TOLRA ,"(Spain, 1928-)",CARLES-TOLRA-Ignacio.jpg,"Originally, from Spain, Carles-Tolra moved to Zurich at the age of 30 where, self-taught, he embarked on art after discovering the writings of Jean Dubuffet. Encouraged by the latter, with whom he maintained an important correspondence, he started drawing at night after his work as a civil servant for the Red Cross. 
Ignacio Carles-Tolra gradually developed a bestiary of enormous diversity, bringing together birds and other composite creatures, often endowed with multiple members, which he refers to as “creatures.” lgnacio Carles-Tolra works on impulse and in haste, often by series, consumed by a fever to be understood.  “It’s anger that motivates me the most, but I have a lot of fun too,” he confesses.  “I draw to heal myself from daily life.” His work may proceed by accident from a spot, scratch, print or collage.
"
Georges,CAUCHY,"(France, 1963 -)",cauchy.JPG,"Some people are difficult; we might even call them stubborn! Well, Georges is one such person: very difficult to communicate with, he has nonetheless some truly remarkable bouts of creativity. At such times, every form submits to his will and takes on more intensity. He uses felt-tip pens, which gives luminosity and transparency to his blocks of color. But you are warned: these works are fragile because the felt-tips employed fade in daylight."
Klaus,COMPAGNIE,"(Belgium, 1972 -)",CompagnieKlaus.jpg,"During his youth, Klaus Compagnie has already been someone who liked commenting on his anecdotal representations. He works with enthusiasm and obsession on the perfect translation of his world. He sketches rudimentary figures in painting, charcoal or in pyrography combined with written comments. Paintings illustrate his unlimited knowledge and unlimited imagination. He realizes portraits, paints historic facts and confronts us with his anatomical knowledge. He gives meteorological indications or events with a personal interpretation in dutch, but also in spanish and in french. He reinforces pictures by text, what convey his works funny and scheming."
Aloïse,CORBAZ ,"(Switzerland, 1886-1964)",Aloise-Corbaz560.jpg,"Having suffered heartbreak, Aloïse, then aged twenty-five, moves to Germany where she takes up the post of governess at the court of Emperor William II. At the start of the war in 1914 she has to go back to Switzerland, and is showing signs of behavioral problems. Her family decides to first commit her to the hospital in Céry then, from 1918 until her death, to the mental hospital of La Rosière in Gimel. Jacqueline PorretForel, the doctor who looks after her, analyses her works and shows them to Jean Dubuffet. Locked-up, Aloïse creates disconcerting works that follow rules which are hers alone. Memories resurface in her drawings: the splendor of the court of William II, royal couples, and theatrical scenery. She doesn’t reproduce them faithfully, but transfers them into a perpetually changing and extremely diverse world."
Sylvain,COSIJNS,"(Belgium, 1932 -)",cosijns.jpg,"Sylvain Cosijns started to live and open up aged 56, when he went to Jan Geldhof’s studio. During his life he accumulated a mass of sensations and experiences, endured and lived through but never communicated. Drawing and painting is his way of reaching out to life and other people. 
The work of Sylvain Cosijns reflects the fragility of things more than heroism: it exudes tremendous purity: bare drawings with a hesitating stroke although maintained.
"
Georges,COUNASSE ,"(Belgium, 1933-2005)",Georges-Counasse-27.jpg,"Eternal enchantment that furrows our childhood memories, the merry-go-rounds of Georges Counasse, a retired baker, turn to the rhythm of record-players that usually serve as their base.  An assembly of elements gleaned from childhood and its rediscovery (small dolls that ride the carrousels, pearls, Christmas garlands, etc.) recreate the fair of the years 1947-1950 of his youth.  Merry-go-round, big wheel, chain carousel, ice palace, and bumper cars awaken a nostalgic happiness in us all."
Antonio,DALLA VALLE ,"(Cles (Trente),Italy, 1939-)",dalla-valle-(41).jpg,"Antonio Dalla Valle always carries his work when he leaves the security of his psychiatric institution. It contains notebooks wrapped in sticky tape, assemblages of felt pens, and Perspex cubes in which he encloses small pieces of paper with scribbled text. He has invented a form of personal, secret writing in which the intimate coexists with the universal."
Serge,DELAUNAY,"(Belgium, 1956 -)",Serge-Delaunay-294.jpg,"In 1978, he joins the Queen Fabiola Centre in Neufvilles where he spends most of his time in the drawing and modelling studio, la Ramée. Being very observant and able to memorise countless details he copies, in his own way, his favourite subjects, i.e. cars, robots, rockets, and any other machine involving complex technology. 
His drawings, made with black felt pen and rotring in ligneclaire style, are supported by texts with technical and mechanical information in which every word seems to be the flagship of the future, the source of progress. Involved with the news and events with intense media coverage, Serge reacts to it and celebrates it in his own way, with empathy and determination.
His drawings and the messages they carry constitute, in the eyes of the visitor, the many relays and traces of an often neglected everyday life. The draughtsman reminds us of our micro-dimension in the face of the space odyssey and its vastness, something the all-knowing Man undoubtedly forgot in his ignorance. Serge delights in this and finds inspiration in these (super) human adventures. To him, these creative moments are synonymous with intense and silent periods of concentration.
"
Paul,DUHEM,"(Belgium, 1919-1999)",Duhem-(1).jpg,"Duhem was seventy when he started to draw and paint. He would always work in the same way. First of all he would cut the sheet of paper down to size with a knife, and then use a length of wood to draw a frame around the sheet. In the top left-hand corner he would write his name, also in a little frame. He had learnt to do this long ago at school. When he worked with paint, he would not use a palette, but emptied the pots into sardine tins. Because of this, his paintings have a restricted number of colors. He never washed out his brushes. The paint became mixed together, and by the time the pots were nearly empty, his work would take on an olive-brown tint. Although Duhem only started painting late in life, he left behind a large body of work. The endless repetition of the same themes gives this work a somewhat enigmatic quality. It is as though there is something that Duhem is always trying to grasp or capture."
Johan,GEENENS,"(Belgium, 1970-)",geenens.jpg,"Johan Geenens has been attending the De Zandberg workshops in Harelbeke since 1992. Starting off with engraving and linocut, his artistic practices expanded into abstract painting and drawing. His “Nogeenkasteel” series (“One more castle”) is composed of entangled lines transformed into distinct, small spaces and interweaved areas. They all take part in a subtle mosaic of colors and forms, at times alternating with wider spaces where his brash strokes (if it is about painting) OR drawing line (if it is about drawing) become freer and less systematic. These contrasts in styles and density invite the viewer to appreciate in each one of the elements of this ensemble its own distinct features."
Juanma,GONZALEZ,"(Spain, 1945 – Belgium, 2007)",Gonzalez.jpg,"He was a driver and became a cobbler.
“I really enjoy taking a shoe apart, discovering its structure, identifying what it’s made of, from the most refined materials to the most ordinary, hand-made or machine-made. It was a bit like taking an engine apart but not so dirty.” A television programme made him want to start painting. One day a new sole he had just fitted, its smell, its shape and its texture, made it the ideal support. He painted a small landscape on it, to which the reactions of his customers varied: “The first time I decorated the soles unasked the lady was delighted. But another customer wasn’t at all pleased.” Juanma’s works are not forgotten, they wear away.
"
Martha,GRÜNENWALDT ,"(Belgium, 1910 – 2008)",Grunenwaldtweb.jpeg,"The artistic activity of Martha Grünenwaldt began in 1981, when she was seventy-one. On the back of a poster or wallpaper, she drew brightly colored pictures with a woman as the apparent centre point. Beside and around the face she painted birds, a violinist, plant motifs, even buildings. 
Over the years, these motifs took over the space from the portraits and in some cases became a tangle of vegetation obscuring Martha completely.
"
,JAKLINE,"(Belgium, 1956-)",Jacquelineok.jpg,"Jakline does not speak readily about her work. (Jakline's work is not a deliberate act of self-expression) Her actions and artwork speak for her instead. She makes lace. One that stings, gets rusty and transmits tetanus. That is chiseled up by fullness and emptiness. Void as some devastated land, abandoned to the projection of our fears/anxieties. A sort of space, inside her iron and nickel cathedrals, where floats the echo of her revolt cried out in silence."
André,ROBILLARD ,"(France, 1932-)",Robillard-10B.jpg,"André Robillard is at times referred to as “the man with guns!” For thirty years, this creator who does not consider himself an artist, makes symbolic guns using tin cans, used light bulbs, old cogwheels, recovered pieces of wood, fabrics, nails, wire and scotch tape.  A multi-disciplinary artist he is also a musician:  percussion improvisations on rubbish bins using empty cartridges placed at the end of the fingers, accordion and harmonica accompanied by very personal songs. 
Present in the largest outsider art collections, this anti-conformist and anti-militarist artist beckons the viewers in a playful manner in spite of himself.
"
Jacques, TROVIC ,"(France, 1948- )",Trovic1149.jpg,"He learnt sewing and embroidering at a very young age from his mother and sister. He created his first tapestry in 1964, in the small miner’s house in a suburb of Valenciennes. He produces tapestries of monumental size on his kitchen table. The themes broached are inspired by the working class tradition, the mine, street scenes, feasts, carnivals, etc. Jacques Trovic embroiders a jute hessian base with fabrics bought on the Anzin market, wool in all colours, sequins, pearls, lace, and patchwork imbued with great poetry and great sensitivity."
