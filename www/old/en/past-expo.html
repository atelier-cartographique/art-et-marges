        <p>This exhibition is intended as a joyous uppercut to the established categroies. It brings together fiction, abstractions, graphical poems, creations without words, free associations of images, unlikely meetings between text and drawing... The classifications are explosing and the defintions eroding to proclaim that the comic strip is a vast playground without limits other than the inventiveness of its creators...</p>

                            The public chose its favourite works from the museum’s extensive collection for the second edition of our Summer collection. It is a unique opportunity to (re)discover many masterpieces by artists such as Yassir Amazine, Aloïse Corbaz, Antonio Dalla Valle, Serge Delaunay, Paul Duhem, Jill Galliéni, Juanma Gonzalez, André Robillard and many others, as well as original works and the latest acquisitions of the museum. The favourites from the MadMusée (Liège) and Doctor Guislain Museum (Ghent) will round off this exhibition.

                            You pass by them every day, but there probably isn’t any eye contact. Their perspective is precisely what defines this project. For this exhibition, Vincen Beeckman distributed disposable cameras to people who live on the streets. Antony, BB, Shérif, Claudia, papa Jan, Julien, Fabian, and many others capture moments that intermix and shape their life into a mosaic.
